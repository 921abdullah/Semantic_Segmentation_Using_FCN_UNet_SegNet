# Semantic Segmentation with Deep Learning

## Overview
Semantic segmentation is a computer vision technique that assigns a semantic label to each pixel in an image. It divides the image into meaningful segments, identifying objects, background, and other elements. Unlike traditional image segmentation techniques, semantic segmentation focuses on understanding the content of the image at a higher level.

### Applications
- **Object Recognition**
- **Scene Understanding**
- **Autonomous Navigation** (e.g., self-driving cars, robotics)

## Models Implemented
This project implements the following models for semantic segmentation:

1. **Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN)**  
   FCN extends traditional convolutional networks by replacing fully connected layers with convolutional layers, allowing for pixel-level predictions.

   **Strengths**:
   - Simpler architecture.
   - Effective for basic segmentation tasks.

   **Weaknesses**:
   - Limited precision due to coarser output resolution.
   - Less effective for complex segmentation tasks.

2. **U-Net**  
   U-Net is a highly effective model with an encoder-decoder structure and skip connections that preserve spatial information.

   **Strengths**:
   - High accuracy due to preserved spatial context.
   - Particularly suited for medical and high-detail segmentation tasks.

   **Weaknesses**:
   - Higher computational cost compared to simpler models.
   - Requires larger memory for training.

3. **SegNet**  
   SegNet uses an encoder-decoder architecture with efficient upsampling techniques to restore spatial resolution.

   **Strengths**:
   - Balances accuracy and computational efficiency.
   - Suitable for real-time applications.

   **Weaknesses**:
   - Slightly less accurate compared to U-Net.
   - Performance varies with dataset complexity.
